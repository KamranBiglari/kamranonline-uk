## Hi, I'm Kamran Biglari

I'm a **Senior DevOps Engineer** based in London, UK, with a passion for cloud computing, infrastructure automation, and building scalable systems. With over 15 years of experience in web hosting services and 12 years as a datacenter administrator, I've had the privilege of working on everything from designing private datacenters to architecting complex multi-cloud environments.

## Professional Journey

Currently, I work as a **Senior DevOps Engineer at New Change FX Ltd**, where I architect and manage enterprise-scale AWS infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code. My work involves:

* Managing **300+ complex Terraform/Terragrunt modules** deploying **11,243+ managed resources**
* Architecting multi-account AWS environments using Control Tower, Transit Gateway, and Direct Connect
* Building and maintaining **460+ ECS Fargate task definitions** with comprehensive service discovery
* Developing custom solutions with NGINX/OpenResty, Lua, Python, and Rust for API gateways and authentication
* Setting up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and automated infrastructure deployments

Before that, I co-founded **Mizban Web Paytakht Ltd** in Tehran, where I designed and set up one of the first private datacenters in the region, providing IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS solutions based on OpenStack and Proxmox.
