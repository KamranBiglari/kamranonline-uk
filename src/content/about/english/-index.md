## Hi, I'm Kamran Biglari

I'm a **Chief Cloud Engineer** based in London, UK, with a passion for cloud computing, infrastructure automation, and building scalable systems. With over 15 years of experience in web hosting services and 12 years as a datacenter administrator, I've had the privilege of working on everything from designing private datacenters to architecting complex multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments.

## Professional Journey

Currently, I serve as **Chief Cloud Engineer at New Change Currency Consultants Ltd**, where I architect and manage enterprise-scale AWS infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code. My work involves:

* Architecting well-architected multi-account AWS infrastructure using Control Tower with Service Control Policies (SCPs)
* Managing **10+ AWS ECS Fargate clusters** with **500+ services** across multiple regions
* Setting up hybrid cloud infrastructure in Hetzner datacenter with **300+ virtual machines**
* Designing **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers** for APIs using Claude AI and AWS Bedrock
* Developing bespoke infrastructure dashboard using Laravel Filament for comprehensive cloud resource management
* Implementing global network architecture with AWS Transit Gateway, DirectConnect to Equinix LD-4 Datacenter
* Managing Kubernetes clusters with AWS integration and multi-cloud orchestration

I'm also the founder of:
* **Cloud Certainty OÜ** (Estonia, 2025-Present) - Specializing in AWS migration architecture, MCP design for AI models, and cloud cost optimization
* **KamranOnline Ltd** (UK, 2022-Present) - Designing custom CRM and ERP systems integrated with platforms like Xero, ExactOnline, and Salesforce

Previously, I founded **Mizban Web Paytakht Ltd** in Tehran, where I designed and set up one of the first private datacenters in the region, providing IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS solutions based on OpenStack and Proxmox.
